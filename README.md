The Heart of Capital Punishment: Execution trends in the American South
FACE EXTRACTION CROP OF EXECUTED DEATH ROW CONVICTS IN TEXAS

This project aims to visualize relevant trends in the significance and character of Texas' capital punishment system. 
In the effort of humanizing the statistics presented, I extracted and captured the images of the individuals executed 
by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice from the agency's <a href='https://www.tdcj.texas.gov/death_row/dr_executed_offenders.html'>Death Row Information</a> database. 

The final visualization can be found <a href='https://public.flourish.studio/story/622962/'>here</a>
